# START

how: Added a new static function `debug_print_hex` to format and print byte arrays as hexadecimal strings. This function handles potential UART busy states and splits long hexdumps into multiple transmissions if necessary. Called this function from `process_accumulated_pm_data` immediately after the initial "Processing accumulated" debug message.
where:
  - File: `src/main.c`
  - New function: `debug_print_hex` (lines approx. 43-110, exact lines depend on final formatting after apply)
  - Call location: Within `process_accumulated_pm_data` function, after the `debug_printf` for "PM: Processing accumulated %u bytes". (around line 126)
why: To provide a raw hexadecimal view of the accumulated PM sensor data for debugging purposes, as requested by the user.
what: Implemented a hexdump output for the `pm_accumulate_buffer` content when `process_accumulated_pm_data` is called. The output is prefixed with "[DEBUG] PM: the hexdump (N bytes):" followed by the space-separated hex values and a newline.

how: Modified the `debug_print_hex` function to improve UART serialization and output accuracy.
where:
  - File: `src/main.c`
  - Function: `debug_print_hex` (lines approx. 43-105 of the modified file)
why: The previously added hexdump was not appearing in the output. This was likely due to the function returning prematurely because of UART busy checks that conflicted with preceding debug messages. This modification makes the hexdump function wait for the hardware UART to be free before attempting to print and ensures the output format includes the `[DEBUG]` prefix as intended.
what:
  - Removed the initial aggressive guard condition from `debug_print_hex`.
  - Ensured the function first waits for `platform_usart_cdc_tx_busy()` to be false before any print attempt.
  - Prepended `[DEBUG] ` to the hexdump's header string, e.g., `[DEBUG] PM: the hexdump (%u bytes):\r\n`.
  - Removed the specific `if (len == 0)` block that called `debug_printf`, as the main logic now correctly handles the `len == 0` case by printing the modified header.
  - Refined buffer full check and line ending logic for clarity and robustness.
