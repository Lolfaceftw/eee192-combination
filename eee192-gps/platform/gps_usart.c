 * @brief Initializes the USART peripheral (SERCOM1) for GPS communication.
 *
 * This function performs the necessary steps to configure SERCOM1 for USART operation:
 * 1. Enables the peripheral clock (GCLK) for SERCOM1, using GCLK_GEN2 (4 MHz).
 * 2. Initializes the context structure `gps_ctx_uart` for managing SERCOM1 state.
 * 3. Resets the SERCOM1 peripheral using a software reset.
 * 4. Configures USART operational parameters:
 *    - Mode: USART with internal clock.
 *    - Sampling: 16x oversampling, arithmetic mode.
 *    - Data order: LSB first.
 *    - Parity: None.
 *    - Stop bits: Two. (Original code sets CTRLB.SBMODE to 0x1 for two stop bits)
 *    - Character size: 8-bit.
 *    - RX Pad: PAD[1]. TX Pad: PAD[0].
 * 5. Sets the baud rate register for a target baud rate (e.g., 38400 bps from 4 MHz GCLK).
 * 6. Configures an idle timeout for reception (3 character times).
 * 7. Enables the receiver and transmitter.
 * 8. Configures the physical I/O pins (PB17 for RX - SERCOM1/PAD[1]) for SERCOM1 functionality.
 *    (Note: TX pin PB16 for SERCOM1/PAD[0] would also need configuration if TX was used by this module).
 * 9. Enables the SERCOM1 peripheral.
